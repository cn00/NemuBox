kBuild / Nemu Build Tricks
==========================


Introduction
------------

This document is written in reStructuredText (rst) which just happens to
be used by Python, the primary language for this revamp.  For more information

Changing the output directory
-----------------------------

When switch between different Nemu build settings it can be nice to have 
different output directories to avoid having to rebuild the whole source tree
everything.  One typical example is hardening, another is guest additions using
crossbuild gcc w/ SDK.  The latter is is simpler so that's the first example:

.. code:: makefile

    ifdef NEMU_WITH_COMPATIBLE_LINUX_GUEST_PACKAGE
     PATH_OUT_BASE = $(PATH_ROOT)/add-out
    endif

The following example is the typical developer setup, i.e. disable hardening by
default but respect command line overrides (kmk NEMU_WITH_HARDENING=1):

.. code:: make

    NEMU_WITH_HARDENING :=
    ifeq ($(NEMU_WITH_HARDENING),)
     NEMU_WITHOUT_HARDENING=1
    else
     PATH_OUT_BASE = $(PATH_ROOT)/hard-out
    endif


Share tools download directory between trunk and branches
---------------------------------------------------------

To avoid filling up your disk with unnecessary tool zip and tar.gz files, set
the FETCHDIR variable in LocalConfig.kmk to point to a common directory for all
Nemu checkouts.

.. code:: make

    FETCHDIR = $(HOME)/Downloads/FetchDir
